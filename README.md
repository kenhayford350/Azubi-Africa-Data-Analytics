# Azubi-Africa-Data-Analytics
A data analytics project using banking campaign data to predict term deposit subscriptions. Includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, ML model development, performance evaluation, and actionable business recommendations.

# ðŸ“Š Term Deposit Subscription Prediction

This repository contains a data analytics project aimed at predicting whether clients will subscribe to a term deposit based on marketing campaign data from a Portuguese bank. The project covers the full data science workflowâ€”from data exploration to model deploymentâ€”and includes actionable business insights.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

To build a machine learning model that predicts a clientâ€™s likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit using features like age, job, education, contact method, call duration, and past campaign outcomes. This helps optimize marketing efforts and improve customer targeting.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Dataset Description

The data comes from direct marketing campaigns conducted via phone calls. The dataset includes:

- `bank-additional-full.csv` â€“ Main dataset used (41,188 records, 20 features).
- Target Variable: `y` (binary â€“ "yes" or "no")

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed distribution of categorical and numerical variables.
- Identified class imbalance, feature importance, and patterns in subscription behavior.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Encoded categorical features.
- Assessed importance of variables (e.g., duration, poutcome, month).
- Addressed class imbalance using oversampling (SMOTE) and class weights.

### 3. Model Building
- Trained multiple ML models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- Selected the best-performing model based on metrics like accuracy, recall, and F1-score.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score evaluated.
- Special handling for imbalanced classes to avoid false positives.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- **Call duration** has the strongest correlation with "yes" outcomes.
- **Cellular contact** outperforms telephone.
- Clients with **positive past responses** are more likely to subscribe.
- **March, September, and December** are peak subscription months.
- **Students, retirees, and highly educated clients** show higher interest.

---

## âœ… Recommendations

- Prioritize **mobile contact methods**.
- **Target campaigns** in peak months (March, Sept, Dec).
- Focus on clients with **prior positive interactions**.
- Avoid using `duration` for live predictionsâ€”only use for post-call evaluation.
- Tailor messaging for **educated and retired demographics**.
